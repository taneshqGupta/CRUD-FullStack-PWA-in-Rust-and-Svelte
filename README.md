#### Personal Side Note

###### But ofcourse, this is still just a minimum viable product, any such IRL consequences based platform must be implemented with heavy security, verification, and blocking features. I would love to implement such features in the future, but as of now, this is just a proof of concept, just an MVP.

###### Although I haven't implemented features like email-verification, IP logging, user-blocking, yet; I have implemented password-hashing in rust so any password you make at time of account creation gets hashed, and not even the creator (me) with access to database, can read your passwords.

###### The code being fully open-source, any one can go and see exactly how passwords hashing is implemented and passwords are stored, which makes your account password completely safe with _Skill-Swap_
