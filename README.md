#### Q: What social problem does _Skill-Swap_ Address?
###### Ans: In times like ours when upskilling always has a cost attached to it, regardless of domain. _Skill-Swap_ offers a  way to share your skills within your local community and get to form social bonds and learn something in return.
###### Intended User-Base: People of all ages, especially those new to any community, be it a city, or a village. People who struggle making friends. People who wish to learn something new & Those who love to teach.

###### [But ofcourse, this is still just a minimum viable product, any such IRL consequences based platform must be implemented with heavy security, verification, and blocking features. I would love to implement such features in the future, but as of now, this is just a proof of concept, just an MVP.]
